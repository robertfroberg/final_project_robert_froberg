						<i>3rd-level Way of the Astral Self feature</i>

					<p>Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.</p>
					<p>For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.</p>
					<p>While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:</p>
					<list>
						<li>You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
						<li>You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.</li>
						<li>When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.</li>

					<p>
						<b>Forms of Your Astral Self</b>
					</p>
					<p>The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur-the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.</p>
					<p>When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your astral self.</p>

					<p>You can douse a creature, object, or space with Oil or use it as fuel, as detailed below.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Dousing a Creature or an Object. </i>
						</b>When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing an Oil flask. Target one creature or object within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an extra 5 Fire damage from burning oil.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Dousing a Space. </i>
						</b>You can take the Utilize action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Fuel. </i>
						</b>Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn't need to be consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a Utilize action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of 6 hours.</p>

					<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Tattoo Attunement. </i>
						</b>To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.</p>
					<p>If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Magical Strikes. </i>
						</b>While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Eldritch Maul. </i>
						</b>As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can reach a target up to 15 feet away from you, as inky tendrils launch toward the target. In addition, your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tattoo Notes</b>
					</p>
					<p>Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles, magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic needles, which transfer their magic to a creature.</p>
